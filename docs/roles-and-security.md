# Roles and security

The database is the authorization authority. `organization_members.role` is the only source of permissions; editable Auth metadata is never consulted for authorization.

| Role | Database access |
| --- | --- |
| Admin / developer | Manage organization event setup, teams, matches, form versions, assignments, and corrections. |
| Scout | Read only events in their assignments, submit only their own assigned data, and review only their own submissions. |
| Strategist | Read event data and submissions, but cannot mutate raw scout entries. |
| Master | Reserved for the Phase 3 device relay workflow. |

Every public table has RLS. Internal policy helpers are `SECURITY DEFINER` only in a non-exposed `private` schema, have fixed empty search paths, and have execute access revoked from public roles. Browser code uses the publishable key only. The photo bucket is private and its select/upload/update/delete policies check the owning submission.

New Supabase Auth users are rejected by a database `BEFORE INSERT` trigger unless their email ends in `@stuypulse.com`. This protects password signup, invitations, and first-time OAuth user creation. The UI repeats the rule for clear feedback, but the trigger is the authority.

## First-admin onboarding

Create the first user through `/auth/login`, then execute the following in a trusted Supabase SQL session, substituting the signed-in user UUID:

```sql
with new_organization as (
  insert into public.organizations (name) values ('StuyPulse') returning id
)
insert into public.organization_members (organization_id, user_id, role)
select id, 'USER_UUID_HERE'::uuid, 'admin'::public.organization_role
from new_organization;
```

This setup action intentionally cannot be performed with the browser's publishable key: granting yourself the first admin role from a public client would defeat the entire role model.
